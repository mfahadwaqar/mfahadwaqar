# About Me

**I’m currently working on:**  
Building scalable data pipelines, analytical dashboards, and AI-driven solutions for transforming data into actionable insights.

**I’m looking to collaborate on:**  
Data engineering, machine learning, automation projects, and open-source tools focused on analytics and workflow optimization.

**I’m looking for help with:**  
Large-scale ETL optimization, cloud-based data workflows, and production-level MLOps practices.

**I’m currently learning:**  
Advanced deep learning, distributed systems, MLOps, and cloud-native data infrastructure.

**Ask me about:**  
Python, SQL, data engineering, machine learning, ETL workflows, dashboarding, and automation.

**Fun fact:**  
I enjoy turning messy datasets into meaningful systems and often automate tasks just to avoid doing them twice.
